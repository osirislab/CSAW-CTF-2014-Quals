# tested on ubuntu 14.04
sudo apt-get install qemu nmap
cd MIPS/run_from_here
./run.sh
# listens on port 8888, change run.sh if you want to change this
# then you can test the solution
# change back to the main directory
ruby ./solution.rb

you should have the flag get printed out

in the event that we want to distribute the x86 one instead. just distribute
the x86/distribute instead of MIPS/distribute and run the x86/run_from_here
run.sh instead
