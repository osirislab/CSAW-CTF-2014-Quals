1) Maybe provide the lib folder (not libchallengeresponse.so) [MIPS ONLY]
2) Stub out the function in libchallengeresponse.so to run the program, your
solution should work for /all/ challenge response pairs.
3) We've managed to get our hands on an x86 version!
(provide the x86/distribute folder) [MIPS ONLY]

if we distribute the x86 originally, there should probably be no hints
